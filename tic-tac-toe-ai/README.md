# Tic-Tac-Toe AI 🎮

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where a human player competes against an **unbeatable AI**.  
The AI is built using the **Minimax algorithm**, with an option to enable **Alpha-Beta pruning** for faster performance.  

The goal is to demonstrate the use of **game theory** and **search algorithms** in building intelligent agents.

---

## ✨ Features
- Play as **X (first)** or **O (second)**.
- Two AI modes:
  - **Plain Minimax** (always optimal but slower).
  - **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** (optimal + faster).
- Interactive web-based UI (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
- Highlights winning moves.
- Mobile-friendly responsive design.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – Structure of the game interface.  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Game logic + AI implementation (Minimax).
